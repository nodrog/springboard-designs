  intro: 'Even a worldwide phenomenon needs a little support act. L’Occitane’s award winning Shea Butter
handcream is in no doubt a global best seller but we couldn’t help notice the metal tubes begin to
look a little dented and jaded from first use so we approached L’Occitane with an exclusive design
for them.'

    <p>We designed a clever key which slides on to the base of their handcreams, and twists up to help the
customer get every last bit of their favourite cream out, and keeping the tube looking dent free.
Having identified best materials fit for purpose, in budget and carefully identifying potential factories
we began technical drawings and sampling with 3 factories before final selection. As it need to fit a
range of different sized handcreams weight was also an important factor. Designed in house by our
creative team with a patent pending. Currently retailing in every corner of the world.</p>

    <p>Initially needed as a promotional item and later as a retail item budget and quality were of real
importance as well as using sustainable cotton canvas and eco-friendly dyes. The end result was a
large branded eyecatching tote, a cute duster bag, and simple pouch with a contrasting zipper and
ribbon pull. Nothing beats your customer being a walking advertisement for your brand. We
understand this one is currently making several appearances on the streets of NYC.</p>

    <p>They came to use requesting a full years supply of premiums and incentives for use across a number
of sectors. We recently delivered a hand towel, pouch, soap tray and comb to be. The handtowel
and pouch needed to be made from recycled cotton, undyed and simple in style. The comb and soap
tray needed to be from a sustainable source (FSC), a soft wood but that would withstand everyday
use. They were used to incentive the customers to encourage purchase and offer a botanical bath
and skincare experience in the home environment: a relaxing escape from reality.</p>

several serious promotional items to make it stand out in a crowded market place and make
delegates remember it! Our creative team came up with the ‘Bladder bag’ which proved so popular

    <p>The hamper we created was a bespoke design after many prototypes. After discussing a variety of
materials, L’Occitane chose paper straw raffia which was unique to the market place, on budget and
could be produced in a variety of colours for future orders. The hamper closure to the top and
orange &amp; white gingham ribbon in corporate colours with a detailed metal logo conveyed a gift filled
with love from Provence to the consumer. Filled with their best selling products, it was a great way
to introduce the brand to an associated audience, had huge strength as a brand recall tool and
proved so successful a variety of mini hampers have been used in global marketing campaigns year
after year.</p>
